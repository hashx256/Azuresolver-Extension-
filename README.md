## 📎 What is this?

The **AzureSolver Extension** is a browser extension that automatically detects and extracts all CAPTCHA parameters from any website — giving you the exact, ready-to-use API payload for [AzureSolver](https://azuresolver.com) in one click.

No more guessing whether it's v2 or v3. No more digging through page source. No more wasted time.

## ✅ Supported CAPTCHA Types

| CAPTCHA | Variants Detected |
|---|---|
| 🔵 **reCAPTCHA v2** | Checkbox · Invisible · Explicit |
| 🟣 **reCAPTCHA v3** | Standard · Score-based |
| 🏢 **reCAPTCHA Enterprise** | v2 Enterprise · v3 Enterprise |
| 🟡 **hCaptcha** | Standard |
| 🟠 **Cloudflare Turnstile** | Standard |

---

## ⚡ How It Works

```
1. Install the extension
2. Visit any site with a CAPTCHA
3. Trigger the target action (login, register, form submit, etc.)
4. Click the extension icon
5. Copy the ready-to-use AzureSolver API params → done
```

The extension uses an **upgrade-wins detection engine** — meaning if multiple signals are detected, it always resolves to the most accurate CAPTCHA type. For example, a page that initially looks like reCAPTCHA v2 Checkbox will be correctly upgraded to reCAPTCHA v3 or Enterprise if stronger signals are found later.

---

## 🔧 Detection Engine Highlights

- 🧠 **Priority-based type resolution** — avoids misidentification when multiple CAPTCHA signals fire
- 📡 **Intercepted network requests** — catches sitekeys from `anchor`, `bframe`, and `/enterprise` endpoints
- 🔍 **Deep DOM scanning** — inspects `.g-recaptcha`, `.h-captcha`, `.cf-turnstile`, `data-sitekey` attributes and more
- 🔄 **Auto-upgrades detections** — e.g. upgrades `v2 Checkbox → Enterprise v3` on reload signals
- 🌐 **Works on all URLs** — including iframes and dynamically loaded CAPTCHA widgets

---

## 🚀 Installation (Manual / Developer Mode)

1. Download or clone this repository
2. Open Chrome → `chrome://extensions/`
3. Enable **Developer Mode** (top right toggle)
4. Click **Load Unpacked**
5. Select the `Azuresolver-extension 2.0/` folder
6. Done — the extension is now active on all sites

> ⚠️ Chrome Web Store release coming soon. Stay tuned!
